# Notes

the require method in node.js is similar to import in Python and the other one in java that I forgot.

./ means look in the current directory./ means look in the current directory

Got the video pop up in the bottom left so I can see it and still have room to type.

ctrl+c cancels the node proccess. Or it just running the file.

# Winows and global objects

I didn't know about the window object.
So a window object is a global object. I get it.

## Commenting

pressing Alt+/ comments things out...
Correction it's Ctrl+/.
You can press it again to decomment them.
I didn't know this but I do know how to use Alt+left click.

To run a JS file in the terminal type "node {filename}" I.E. "node test".
